# TRANSTU-Open-Data

 Various [TRASNTU](https://www.transtu.tn/fr/)(Soci√©te de transport de Tunis) datasets for metro/bus stations, lines, timetables, etc. Sourced from [TRANSTU entries in data.transport.tn](http://data.transport.tn/group/62111085-2824-4f9f-b274-249b1747a9b1?organization=sncft).

 I will be updating these into JSON and reformatting the various datasets into a more accessible, more parsable, and familiar structure.

 As these datasets may be outdated (There's some conflict already between the entries because of winter/summer timetable differences), the next step would be to parse the published timetables that are in image format from [here](https://www.transtu.tn/fr/0103-marche-horaire-hiver-2022-2023.html).
